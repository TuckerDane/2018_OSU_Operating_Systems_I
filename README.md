# 2018_OSU_Operating_Systems_I
## Assignment I - Matrix
In this assignment I was asked to write bash shell scripts to compute matrix operations. The purpose was to get familiar with the Unix shell, shell programming, Unix utilities, standard input, output, and error, pipelines, process ids, exit values, and signals (at a basic level).
## Assignment II - Adventure
This assignment asked me to write a simple game akin to old text adventure games like [Adventure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure).
I wrote two programs that introduced me to programming in C on UNIX based systems, and familiarized me with reading and writing files. 
## Assignment III - Small Shell
In this assignment, I wrote my own shell in C, similar to bash. No other languages, including C++, were allowed, though I could use any version of C, such as C99. The shell runs command line instructions and return the results similar to other shells I've used, but without many of their fancier features. This particular assignment is still a work in progress, and I will be updating it on my own time in order to fully fill out the features I want to have implemented.
## Assignment IV - One Time Pads
This assignment asked me to create five small programs that encrypt and decrypt information using a one-time pad-like system with this article as a reference: [OTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad). I combined the multi-processing code I learned with socket-based inter-process communication. My programs are accessible from the command line using standard UNIX features like input/output redirection, and job control. Finally, I wrote short compilation script.

## Assignment Py - Program Py
a simply Python script written, compiled, and executed in Bash. Wrote this to learn a little bit about Python
